## Drilling Formula Calculator
Drilling Formula Calculator is an interactive Streamlit web application designed for drilling engineers, students, and field personnel. It provides a comprehensive suite of calculators and reference tools for common drilling engineering formulas, including hydraulics, well control, drilling fluids, directional drilling, and more.

Features: 

Basic Drilling Formulas: Accumulator capacity, annular velocity, hydrostatic pressure, slug volume, and more.

Applied Drilling Formulas: Drill collar weight, ECD, annular volume, pump output, and other operational calculations.

Drill String Formulas: Tensile capacity and related string mechanics.

Hydraulic Formulas: Annular pressure loss, bit nozzle pressure drop, hydraulic horsepower, surge & swab pressure, and more.

Drilling Fluid Formulas: Bulk density, oil/water ratio, YP & PV, dilution, and mixing calculations.

Well Control Formulas: Kick tolerance, kill mud weight, ICP/FCP, volumetric methods, and more.

Directional Drilling Calculations: Survey methods, dogleg severity, and trajectory tools.

Visual Aids: Each calculator includes explanations and, where relevant, diagrams or images.

User-Friendly Navigation: Organized by main categories and sub-tabs for quick access.
