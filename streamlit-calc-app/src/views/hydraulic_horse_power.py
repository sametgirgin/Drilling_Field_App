    Hydraulic Horse Power is a measure of the energy per unit of time that is being expended 
    across the bit nozzles. It is commonly calculated by this equation, HHP=P*Q/1714, 
    where P stands for pressure in pounds per square in., Q stands for flow rate 
    in gallons per minute, and 1714 is a conversion factor necessary to yield HHP 
    in terms of horsepower. Bit manufacturers often recommend that fluid hydraulics 
    energy across the bit nozzles be in a particular HHP range, for example 2.0 to 7.0 HHP, 
    to ensure adequate bit tooth and bottom-of-hole cleaning (the minimum HHP) and to 
    avoid premature erosion of the bit itself (the maximum HHP).
    
    HHP = (P ร Q) รท 1714

    Where:  
    - HHP = Hydraulic Horse Power  
    - P = Circulating pressure (psi)  
    - Q = Circulating rate (gpm)  
    - 1714 = Conversion factor
